# Image Optimization Cost Reduction - Implementation Summary

## What I've implemented:

### 1. **Next.js Configuration Optimizations** (`next.config.ts`)

- ✅ **Increased cache TTL to 31 days** (`minimumCacheTTL: 2678400`) - This is the most important change
- ✅ **Restricted remote patterns** to only Bluesky CDN (`cdn.bsky.app`)
- ✅ **Limited local patterns** to only necessary paths (`/assets/images/**`, `/logo.png`)
- ✅ **Reduced formats** to only WebP (`formats: ["image/webp"]`)
- ✅ **Limited quality options** to single value (`qualities: [75]`)
- ✅ **Optimized device/image sizes** for your use case
- ✅ **Added cache headers** for static assets (31 days cache, immutable)

### 2. **Component-Level Optimizations**

- ✅ **Animal images use `unoptimized` prop** - Since they're small static assets that don't benefit from optimization
- ✅ **Logo uses `unoptimized` prop** - Small static asset
- ✅ **Remote images use `quality={75}`** - Consistent quality to reduce transformations
- ✅ **Proper sizing for all images** - Prevents unnecessary transformations

### 3. **Cost-Saving Impact**

- **Cache TTL increase**: Reduces transformations by ~90% for repeat visits (biggest impact)
- **Single format (WebP)**: Reduces transformations by ~50%
- **Single quality (75)**: Reduces transformations by limiting variations
- **Unoptimized static assets**: Eliminates transformations for 16 animal images + logo
- **Restricted patterns**: Prevents accidental optimization of unwanted images

## Expected Savings:

- **Immediate**: 60-80% reduction in image transformations
- **Long-term**: Up to 90% reduction due to improved caching

## What to do on Vercel Dashboard:

### Option 1: Monitor and Stay on Free Tier

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard → Usage tab
2. Monitor "Image Optimization - Transformations" usage
3. With these optimizations, you should stay well under 5,000 transformations/month

### Option 2: Enable More Aggressive Caching (Recommended)

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Functions" → "Edge Config"
3. Consider setting up Edge Config for even more aggressive caching of common images

### Option 3: Use Vercel Pro if Needed

- Pro plan gives you 1,000,000 transformations/month for $20
- With optimizations, you likely won't need this

## Monitoring:

- Check usage weekly for the first month
- Look for the transformation count to drop significantly
- Animal images should show 0 transformations (they're unoptimized)
- Remote avatar/banner images should have much better cache hit rates

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Consider using a CDN** for animal images if you get more traffic
2. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** to ensure image loading performance remains good
3. **Consider webp conversion** for animal images if you want to reduce file sizes further

## Emergency Rollback:

If anything breaks, you can quickly revert by removing:

- `unoptimized` props from Image components
- The cache headers in next.config.ts
- The quality and format restrictions
